        <p>This website is owned and created by Ethan Ng'ang'a Wachira. Ethan created this website to provide a resource that allows one to express how they feel, which he saw fit since speaking your mind or rather writing your thoughts down has various benefits, most of all bettering your mental health.</p>
        <p>Ethan is currently pursuing a degree in Bachelors of Business and Information Technology at Strathmore University. He aims at enhancing the website even more and making sure it reaches the right audience.</p>
